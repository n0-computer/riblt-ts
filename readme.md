## Maintenance Status: Tier 3
This is a "tier 3" repository from number 0. This means that someone wrote this code largely as a throwaway / one-off, and don't intend to maintain it. 

We likely won't address bugs or issues in tier 3 repos, and will be slow to respond to pull requests. Feel free to fork this & make it great, or reach out to us on the [iroh discord](https://iroh.computer/discord) if you aren't getting a prompt response on this code. Again, no promises we'll be able to do anything about it.
